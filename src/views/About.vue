        My journey into Frontend Web Development began in 2018 when I built a simple login page,
        sparking my passion for creating intuitive and visually engaging digital experiences. This
        passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Applied Science in Informatics Engineering, which I
        earned in 2022.

        Since then, I have been working as a Frontend Web Developer at a startup in South Tangerang,
        where I focus on developing a Queue Management System and Device Monitoring System for
        clients across various industries. Using Vue, Next.JS, WebSocket, and modern frontend
        technologies, I build dynamic, user-centric solutions that enhance efficiency and real-time
        interactions. My experience has strengthened my technical skills and deepened my
        understanding of crafting seamless, impactful digital experiences.
