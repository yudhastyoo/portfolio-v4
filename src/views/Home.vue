      I was born in 1999 in the lively city of Jakarta, Indonesia. As a Frontend Web Developer, I’m
      passionate about building clean, intuitive, and visually appealing digital experiences. I love
      blending design and code to create user-focused applications that don’t just work well, but
      also look and feel great.
